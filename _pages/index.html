title: Thailand | Real people, real journeys


intro: >
  <p class="p--xxxxl text--medium">We want to showcase the wonders of the ultimate Secret Escape to Thailand through the eyes of the traveller, and we want YOU to experience it!</p>
  <p class="p--xxxl text--medium">We are looking for a passionate travelling duo to send on the trip of a lifetime. Accompanied by a small film crew you will get to taste, meet, see, feel, LIVE the very best of Thailand. Are you ready?</p>


journey:

  - title: Your adventure begins in Bangkok
    content: >
      <p>There’s a reason why Thailand is such a well-loved travel destination, but don’t just take our word for it. On this trip, you’ll get up close to the floating food markets in Bangkok, explore ornate temples, try your hand at a cooking class and travel by tuk tuk along the bustling streets before you immerse yourself in Bangkok’s legendary nightlife. </p>

  - title: Relax in tropical Thailand
    content: >
      <p>Then we’ll send you south to the islands. First stop, Phuket. Adventure through sea caves, kayak in blue lagoons and marvel at the limestone cliffs that surround you. After all that activity, you might be in need of some rest and relaxation, and lucky for you, your last stop is dreamy Khao Lak where pristine beaches and  crystal clear waters await. Take a boat trip out to sea and snorkel among the tropical fish. Lush nature is also on the cards with a bamboo rafting trip through the jungle where you’ll feel the spray of the majestic waterfalls. </p>

  - title: Choose your travel partner
    content: >
      <p>Social distancing has meant some of us have been away from our loved ones for the longest periods of our lives. Now that we can safely be together again, we want to know who you would choose to spend this once in a lifetime experience with? Perhaps an adventurous parent who’s always dreamed of travelling to Thailand, or a budding young photography friend who has some serious talent to show off? Maybe it’s someone who lives halfway around the world who you haven’t seen for years and you want to reunite in one of the greatest places on earth?</p>

  - title: The time has come
    content: >
      <p>Thailand is more than ready to welcome guests back, and after a period of no travel, it’s arguably more beautiful than ever. The beaches are sparse and plentiful, making it easy to feel like you have them to yourself.
